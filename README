A script to ease the installation and configuration of postsfix on a home linux server (Ubuntu 14.04.1 in this case).
The intention is to make that server able to email out via the given smtp server reports on cron jobs run etc.
It is very likely to work on most modern debian derivatives though, although it is not tested on anything else, at lease by me

It is not intended to server as a mail server for all lan machines instead is configured purely to allow that server to 
authenticate with a relayhost / smarthost out on the internet and send all machine local email to an address given during the configuration.

N.B. The authentication method is downgraded from the default TLS of postfix to allow the use of smtp servers that do not offer
that connection method but instead use the depricated SSL port 465 method.  To facilitate this the script installs, after
asking if it is OK to do so, stunnel4 and configures it to work as an agent for postfix.

Hope it helps someone.
